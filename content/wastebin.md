# Wastebin
Write and fail  
Write and fail  
Crumble the paper  
Into the wastebin  
to die  
Try try try  
To achieve that light  
That light beams  
perfection  
or so you think  
The light often  
illuminates parts  
That you did not  
see  
did not think of  
before  
Maybe all those  
attempts  
Made the beam  
brighter
