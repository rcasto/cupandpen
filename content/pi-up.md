## pi-up

I made a thing.

This thing is simple.

It helps me make sure my [Raspberry Pi is always up to date](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md) as well as the [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) instance running on it.

It's called [pi-up](https://github.com/rcasto/pi-up).

You can define a configuration that enables you to customize the scheduled runs of the update, as well as the location of the script to run.

So yes, you can really make this script do anything. I just simply made the default with this project update the raspberry pi...cause that's all I wanted.

Oh...and you can also add an email address to the configuration as well. This email address will be sent an email of the script executions output. It'll look like it came from you just FYI. It may show up in junk folder too, it's not super legit, but works.

Anyways, that's it. Cheers!
