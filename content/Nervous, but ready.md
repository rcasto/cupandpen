## Nervous, but ready

I tremble, I shake

I am scared

I am nervous

How will I do?

Am I ready for this?

Mind racing with paths that are not yet traveled

Panic rises

Deep breath

Another one

Be present

Easier said than done

Deep breath

I feel slightly better

Deep breath

Keep it going

Deep breath

I am still nervous

But yet, it is more manageable

I think I've done my best

I am ready
