## You're in control

The shoelace snaps

The bus rolls away just as your arrive

The light turns red, just for you

You're having a bad time

Or, so you think

This is a choice

You're dealt blows all the time

This is no different

The small

The big

No matter

Choices, choices

Don't get me wrong

Be mad

Be sad

Be whatever

Just know

That's all you
