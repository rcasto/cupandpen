Well, somewhat recently I [wrote about how this site was running on a raspberry pi](/content/Running%20on%20Pi), but since then a good bit has happened.

I actually moved across the country during this pandemic, I started a new job, more life, and somewhere along the way I decided to move this site from being hosted on a raspberry pi, to now being hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I digress, during the move I had moved this site to being hosted on Google Cloud, but that time has now passed.

A lot of the principles or ideas incorporated in the hosting and deployment of the site now, come from the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) principles, or at least are inspired by it some haha.

Main idea now being that instead of always re-rendering the static content on each request or even using a cache to hold "hot" static content, just pre-build the HTML views for this content to be served to the client.

It's nothing incredibly complex, it honestly just makes a lot of sense, and I feel silly for doing it any other way before now haha.

This site is essentially static now, almost CDN like, there are of course a few scripts/web components incorporated on the page, but they are not absolutely essential. Feel free to view the site without Javascript.

As part of this migration, I had also made the repository for this site public, so you can now take a look at the [code for this site on GitHub.](https://github.com/rcasto/cupandpen)

Ohhh I guess timestamps are also a new addition added to this site. You'll notice that some of the content is bunched to the same day and I likely didn't write all of it in one day, maybe some, but likely not, I honestly forget.

Main reason that is the case is that I re-created some of the files before, which adjusted that creation time (womp womp). But from now on they should be more accurate, and with that I will try to hold myself more accountable in producing or at least writing more.

Prepare to be bugged more world! Haha.
