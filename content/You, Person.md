## You, Person

Hey you!

Yeah you.

You are my target audience.

I write this for you.

I tailor it so much for you, that you wonder if it is you thinking this.

Was this me.

Maybe in some way it was.

You probably thought of this too, at least once.

Familiarity breeds connection, connection fosters trust.

I want you to trust me. I know I must earn that.

When you are understood, you feel heard.

When you are ignored, you are hurt.

Emotions can get mixed up, you yourself can become confused.

You are vulnerable, we are vulnerable, we are in this together.

I ramble on about things, but hope that you will listen.

To all, I doubt it, to some, still likely not.

To the random things, I thought no one would remember.

Most likely so.

We are goofy, and others love that.

It shows who you are, how you think, and that you are human.

We hide this too often, and we forget just how wonderful it is.

This writing is jumbled, jumpy, and imperfect, but so am I.

Perfection is overrated.
