Words, art, sound

I put it in the grinder to blend

Heat up the water

Throwing in some personal experience

And picked up ideas

Hot special water over grinded blend

Mix together and filter out some noise

Drip drip drip

Poured into cup

More words, more art, more sound

Recycle through the blend again

More and more flow

The flavor ever finer

Bolder and bolder
