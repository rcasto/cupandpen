A long time ago I attempted to make a [mantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra) for myself. A succinct phrase/idea that I would attempt to follow for the rest of my life.

I do believe I have improved and followed this mantra for the most part, but of course, as everyone does, they do veer off course at times. That is ok.

The mantra I came up with was this:

> Be a rock that likes to climb.

Delving into my thoughts behind this. I imagine myself as a rock, who I truly am is who I am. I can't change that. I can improve though or climb.

It may be hard to imagine a rock climbing, but this demonstrates that it can be hard for any of us to change. It takes effort to employ or enact the changes you wish to happen.

I am still climbing to where I want to be and will continue to do so. Through struggles, failures, successes, sadness, happiness, and more.

Outlook is key, and so is at least a fuzzy destination or ambitious idea of where you want to go.

Let's climb together!
