## Pandemic

Another message to ease your mind

Let you know that this shall pass

If we stick together (distanced of course)

Don't let this message be wasted though

Echoed until white noise and then nothing

After this do we disband?

No, we are still here

Occupying space with life

One grain of sand, among many

Falling together in this hourglass of time
