## Life is a draft

In school, you're typically told to get started on an assignment early.

Then of course, you most typically avoid that advice and postpone until...oh shit! 

If it is a writing assignment you most likely type it quickly and don't spend much time re-reading it over.

Most likely there are errors, so is life. Writing assignments aside...

Whatever control you do have over the trajectory of your life, is decided upon, by you. 

The random situations that you end in by crazy circumstances may in some ways be controlled by you and the circumstances you typically reside yourself in.

They could of course, just be that, random, and merged within the fabric of other events in the universe, building an interwoven set of events that unless stepped back upon and analyzed at a macroscopic scale would not be able to be noticed much at all, by you and your local context of awareness.

You poor thing.

What do you do?

You don't know any better?

Why should you?

There is already enough to worry about in the world, being a living being with a consciousness and understanding.
