## Bukowski

I think I wish  
to be  
the modern day Bukowski  
even though  
he really wasn't that  
long ago...  
I haven't read him  
in a bit  
but,  
He sticks with me  
as a young man (if that's important to you)  
I'm a dirty motherfucker  
You are too, shithead  
don't fucking lie  
Yes, offensive words.  
Yes, truth.
