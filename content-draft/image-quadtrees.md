## Image Quadtrees

I've been messing around with quadtrees a lot recently and a couple interesting use cases surround images.

I'll talk mainly about 2 different scenarios:

- Compression
- Animation/drawing/art

Let's start talking...

### Compression

Find a photo, any photo. Look at it, no I mean, really look at it. Notice all the different colors, but also notice how many times the color is the same. Typically around a pixel the colors are more likely to be of the same color or near it. Serving as a sort of principle of locality. Quadtrees model this well.

Since an image is already a 2d bound (a rectangle).

### Animation/drawing/art
