            <h2>Mantra</h2>
            <p>A long time ago I attempted to make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mantra</a> for myself. A succinct phrase/idea that I would attempt to follow for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I do believe I have improved and followed this mantra for the most part, but of course, as everyone does, they do veer off course at times. That is ok.</p>
<p>The mantra I came up with was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be a rock that likes to climb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Delving into my thoughts behind this. I imagine myself as a rock, who I truly am is who I am. I can't change that. I can improve though or climb.</p>
<p>It may be hard to imagine a rock climbing, but this demonstrates that it can be hard for any of us to change. It takes effort to employ or enact the changes you wish to happen.</p>
<p>I am still climbing to where I want to be and will continue to do so. Through struggles, failures, successes, sadness, happiness, and more.</p>
<p>Outlook is key, and so is at least a fuzzy destination or ambitious idea of where you want to go.</p>
<p>Let's climb together!</p>
