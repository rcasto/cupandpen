Yeah you.
You are my target audience.
I write this for you.
I tailor it so much for you, that you wonder if it is you thinking this.
Was this me.
Maybe...">

            <h2>You, Person</h2>
            <p>Hey you!</p>
<p>Yeah you.</p>
<p>You are my target audience.</p>
<p>I write this for you.</p>
<p>I tailor it so much for you, that you wonder if it is you thinking this.</p>
<p>Was this me.</p>
<p>Maybe in some way it was.</p>
<p>You probably thought of this too, at least once.</p>
<p>Familiarity breeds connection, connection fosters trust.</p>
<p>I want you to trust me. I know I must earn that.</p>
<p>When you are understood, you feel heard.</p>
<p>When you are ignored, you are hurt.</p>
<p>Emotions can get mixed up, you yourself can become confused.</p>
<p>You are vulnerable, we are vulnerable, we are in this together.</p>
<p>I ramble on about things, but hope that you will listen.</p>
<p>To all, I doubt it, to some, still likely not.</p>
<p>To the random things, I thought no one would remember.</p>
<p>Most likely so.</p>
<p>We are goofy, and others love that.</p>
<p>It shows who you are, how you think, and that you are human.</p>
<p>We hide this too often, and we forget just how wonderful it is.</p>
<p>This writing is jumbled, jumpy, and imperfect, but so am I.</p>
<p>Perfection is overrated.</p>
