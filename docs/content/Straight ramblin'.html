            <h2>Straight ramblin&apos;</h2>
            <p>I just opened up the tool I typically use to produce/write this content. What am I going to write about?....I don&apos;t really know, I&apos;m basically winging as we go on....righhhhhhttttt now. I&apos;m just stalling, but I&apos;ll try to keep going, I haven&apos;t really collected my thoughts or generally thought of a direction for this yet. This is of course just stream of consciousness. And damn, that is a hard word to type...consciencenous. I don&apos;t think I spelled it write that time. I&apos;m not going back fixing that mistake though, so go with it, gloss it over, and forgive me, you&apos;ve got better things to do... I know it. In fact, there are probably much better things to do than read this, but I thank you for sticking it through at least this far. You can leave now, go on, just do it. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing, but I&apos;ll attempt to go on a little further. Through forcing myself to write and maybe even write exactly what comes to mind stream of consciousness style, like this, and there&apos;s that word again, will likely help me become better at writing. Or ya know, just annoy more people on the internet better. Either way, it&apos;s something,. There you go, you got something, and hopefully this something is a something that you liked or rather found amusing. It was kind of fun doing it.</p>
