            <h2>pi-up</h2>
            <p>I made a thing.</p>
<p>This thing is simple.</p>
<p>It helps me make sure my <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi is always up to date</a> as well as the <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank">Pi-hole</a> instance running on it.</p>
<p>It&apos;s called <a href="https://github.com/rcasto/pi-up" target="_blank">pi-up</a>.</p>
<p>You can define a configuration that enables you to customize the scheduled runs of the update, as well as the location of the script to run.</p>
<p>So yes, you can really make this script do anything. I just simply made the default with this project update the raspberry pi...cause that&apos;s all I wanted.</p>
<p>Oh...and you can also add an email address to the configuration as well. This email address will be sent an email of the script executions output. It&apos;ll look like it came from you just FYI. It may show up in junk folder too, it&apos;s not super legit, but works.</p>
<p>Anyways, that&apos;s it. Cheers!</p>
