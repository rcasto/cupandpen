            <h2>COVID-19 Report</h2>
            <p>I made something, it's not pretty, but it gives you a view of the raw data around COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>You can view it at:<br>
<a href="https://covid19-report.today" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://covid19-report.today</a></p>
<p>It makes use of <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data made available by Johns Hopkins CSSE</a>.</p>
<p>There is a worker job that will check if there are any new reports every couple of minutes, so as soon as a new report is uploaded, it will be made available on <a href="https://covid19-report.today" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the site</a>.</p>
<p>The one functionality layered on top of this data, is the ability to sort by cases nearest you. Don't worry, your location never leaves the client, if you are worried about that. It's mainly for educational purposes and allows people to view the impact of COVID-19 in their area.</p>
<p>The repo is available at:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/rcasto/covid19-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/rcasto/covid19-report</a></p>
<p>And that's all. Cheers, and stay safe folks!</p>
