            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>Privacy, do we know what that is anymore?</p>
<p>Or are we growing in an age where it is expected that we get less and less of this?</p>
<p>People on screens nowadays everywhere, many on apps, the web, social networks, and more.</p>
<p>We are tracked, maybe not personally identified at all times, but tracked nonetheless.</p>
<p>I, of course, write here, then post it to the web. My ISP knows or possibly can track what I am doing. The browser I use can (in theory) track what I am viewing if desired.</p>
<p>I search for something I can be tracked via the search engine provider. I walk in public there are cameras on street corners that can potentially identify me via facial recognition, I am tracked. I use a credit card to pay for a coffee at my local coffee shop, I can be tracked.</p>
<p>Can you go about your day without being tracked anymore in some way?</p>
<p>For the average person, I think not. If you really wanted to, you probably could, but would have to go to extreme measures.</p>
<p>I'll just sit in my apartment windows closed, candles on, and read a paperback book. Then maybe I can get some privacy. I play, but this is reality, you will be tracked.</p>
