            <h2>Running on Static</h2>
            <p>Well, somewhat recently I <a href="/content/Running%20on%20Pi">wrote about how this site was running on a raspberry pi</a>, but since then a good bit has happened.</p>
<p>I actually moved across the country during this pandemic, I started a new job, more life, and somewhere along the way I decided to move this site from being hosted on a raspberry pi, to now being hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a>. I digress, during the move I had moved this site to being hosted on Google Cloud, but that time has now passed.</p>
<p>A lot of the principles or ideas incorporated in the hosting and deployment of the site now, come from the <a href="https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamstack</a> principles, or at least are inspired by it some haha.</p>
<p>Main idea now being that instead of always re-rendering the static content on each request or even using a cache to hold "hot" static content, just pre-build the HTML views for this content to be served to the client.</p>
<p>It's nothing incredibly complex, it honestly just makes a lot of sense, and I feel silly for doing it any other way before now haha.</p>
<p>This site is essentially static now, almost CDN like, there are of course a few scripts/web components incorporated on the page, but they are not absolutely essential. Feel free to view the site without Javascript.</p>
<p>As part of this migration, I had also made the repository for this site public, so you can now take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/rcasto/cupandpen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code for this site on GitHub.</a></p>
<p>Ohhh I guess timestamps are also a new addition added to this site. You'll notice that some of the content is bunched to the same day and I likely didn't write all of it in one day, maybe some, but likely not, I honestly forget.</p>
<p>Main reason that is the case is that I re-created some of the files before, which adjusted that creation time (womp womp). But from now on they should be more accurate, and with that I will try to hold myself more accountable in producing or at least writing more.</p>
<p>Prepare to be bugged more world! Haha.</p>
