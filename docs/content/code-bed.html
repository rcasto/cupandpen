            <h2>code-bed</h2>
            <p>I&apos;ve been making a good bit of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" target="_blank">web components</a> recently. Trying to figure out good ways to distribute and integrate them.</p>
<p>Through this process I&apos;ve been then incorporating them into this site. So far it&apos;s:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rcasto/readability-component" target="_blank">readability-component</a> - web component for readability and average reading time of content</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rcasto/social-contact" target="_blank">social-contact</a> - web component to display social network icons linking to your profile(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another one being added to this list, is <a href="https://github.com/rcasto/code-bed" target="_blank">code-bed</a>, a web component for embedded CodePens.</p>
<p><code-bed data-slug-hash="ExVoXKW"></code-bed></p>
<p>Got a little meta there, and made a CodePen that can embed a CodePen, even embedding itself.</p>
<p>All of this embedding though, is <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/embedded-pens/" target="_blank">driven by what CodePen already offers</a>.</p>
<p>The web component aspect for the most part provides an easier interface for utilization, at least in my opinion haha.</p>
<p><code-bed data-slug-hash="JBlCc"></code-bed></p>
<p>I&apos;m just having fun with them now haha. (I didn&apos;t make that by the way)</p>
<p>One thing that differentiated making this web component, is that it isn&apos;t something, at least now, that is incorporated within this site in any particular static pattern.</p>
<p>The usage of the code-bed web component is driven by its usage in content. Making for a more dynamic pattern.</p>
<p>Particularly I wanted it such that when I am writing this content, I can invoke a special syntax that then allows me to make use a library of web components that are available in the context of the site it is rendered on.</p>
<p>In this case the secret incantation is simply the normal declaritive usage of the web component desired. So for code-bed it looks something like <code>&lt;code-bed data-slug-hash&quot;wVGGzV&quot;&gt;&lt;/code-bed&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>So while that is the version I see, the version you see is:</p>
<p><code-bed data-slug-hash="wVGGzV"></code-bed></p>
<p>There is one slight danger to this methodology as it requires the content be interpreted as HTML. An alternative methodology would utilize a transformation layer to convert from some pre-defined activation command into the corresponding HTML representation during render.</p>
<p>Anyway I&apos;m just gonna have a little more fun and add one more, mainly cause I can now haha.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
