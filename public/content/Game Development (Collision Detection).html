            <h2>Game Development (Collision Detection)</h2>
            <p>I've been playing the game <a href="https://hempuli.com/baba/" target="_blank">Baba Is You</a> recently on my Nintendo Switch.<br>
This game has surprisingly simple art, looking like it could have been made in the 80's.<br>
The core of the game though, the rules, is something I find super interesting.</p>
<p>Playing this game has made me want to make a game. I think it's the simplicity of the art and the demonstration that the core mechanics of the game are what really matter.</p>
<p>So I've went about learning how to make a game.<br>
I want to make it for the web first, so I started re-learning how to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API" target="_blank">Canvas Web API</a>.<br>
Then trying to think through the basics of the game animation loop.  MDN also has a good article on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Anatomy" target="_blank">anatomy of a web game</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the model I've come up with to start:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get all objects in the world</li>
<li>Filter to objects in the particular scene that can move/animate</li>
<li>Update each objects internal state, producing their next render state</li>
<li>Check internal state of objects to check for collisions, or out of bounds objects and resolve them</li>
<li>Render objects to screen (next frame)</li>
<li>Repeat (schedule next animation tick)</li>
</ol>
<p>Trying my hand at a 2D game.<br>
To check for collisions I've decided to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree" target="_blank">QuadTree</a>, which can break down the 2D space and reduce the # of collision comparisons needed to be made between objects.</p>
<p>In incorporating a QuadTree, I went ahead and built my own little javascript library called <a href="https://github.com/rcasto/simplequad" target="_blank">simplequad</a>.</p>
<p>It is meant to aid in doing one thing well and that is collision detection. You pass in objects implementing a <code>Bound</code> interface. This allows simplequad to then bucket your objects appropriately. Then you can query the QuadTree produced with a boundary to see what objects are in said boundary window. If 2 objects are within the bounds of 1 objects bounding container, you have a collision.</p>
<p>On to the next topic to learn more onâ€¦collision resolution. I can detect collisions pretty well, but not so great at resolving them at the moment.</p>
