It essentially contributes towards the average number of syllables per word in a piece of text.

At this point, figuring out the number of syllables for a word would only be a matter of looking that word up in the stored dictionary.</p>\n<p>The opposite end of the spectrum is using a completely rules based approach. Given a word, a series of rules, such as the above, is ran against the word, then a number representing the amount of syllables for that word is output.</p>\n<p>Typically the best approach though, seems to be a hybrid. Storing a chosen corpus of words mapping to there syllable counts for lookup, then using rules based syllable count approaches on words not contained in this &quot;offline&quot; dictionary.</p>\n<p>This is actually how the readability-component works.</p>\n<p>Before selecting an offline dictionary, I wanted to understand how the rules above performed on a set of words. For this, I used hyphenation data made available via the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project\" target=\"_blank\">Moby Project</a>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Data descriptor</th>\n<th>Data value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of words for which rules correctly identified syllable count</td>\n<td>127,317</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of words for which rules incorrectly identified syllable count</td>\n<td>43,898</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of words for which syllable count was wrong and are common words</td>\n<td>1,063</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of words in Moby Project corpus</td>\n<td>187,175</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Numer of words filtered out from Moby Project corpus (word contains hyphen or space, &gt; 6 syllables)</td>\n<td>15,960</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of words within Moby Project corpus used in calculations</td>\n<td>171,215</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Percentage of words for which syllable counts were correctly identified by rules</td>\n<td>74.361%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Average difference from rules based syllable count to real syllable count on incorrectly identified words</td>\n<td>1.055</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/rcasto/readability-component/tree/master/data\" target=\"_blank\">code used to generate this performance test</a> can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/rcasto/readability-component\" target=\"_blank\">readability-component repository</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking at the data above, it can be seen that the rules do surprisingly well. Correctly identifiying around 70% of syllable counts of words in the Moby Project corpus.</p>\n<p>Then, when the rules are wrong, they are on average off by around 1 syllable.</p>\n<p>Still though, there are around 43,000 words on which it was wrong. That's still sizable, but is all that needs to be focused on, since the rules work well in other cases.</p>\n<p>I wanted to trim this further, as this dictionary would be served in the readability-component javascript bundle. With that, I wanted to store locally what would be the most impactful. My theory may not be the best, but is simple enough. Only store words for which the rules were incorrect and are also considered common words.</p>\n<p>For a corpus of common words I made use of the <a href=\"https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english\" target=\"_blank\">10,000 most common English words derived from Google's Trillion Word Corpus</a>.</p>\n<p>From the 43,000 cases where the rules were incorrect, I then ran these words against the common words list to see if they were common.

			"text": "code-bed\nI've been making a good bit of web components recently. Trying to figure out good ways to distribute and integrate them.\nThrough this process I've been then incorporating them into this site. So far it's:\n\nreadability-component - web component for readability and average reading time of content\nsocial-contact - web component to display social network icons linking to your profile(s)\n\nAnother one being added to this list, is code-bed, a web component for embedded CodePens.\n\nGot a little meta there, and made a CodePen that can embed a CodePen, even embedding itself.\nAll of this embedding though, is driven by what CodePen already offers.\nThe web component aspect for the most part provides an easier interface for utilization, at least in my opinion haha.\n\nI'm just having fun with them now haha. (I didn't make that by the way)\nOne thing that differentiated making this web component, is that it isn't something, at least now, that is incorporated within this site in any particular static pattern.\nThe usage of the code-bed web component is driven by its usage in content. Making for a more dynamic pattern.\nParticularly I wanted it such that when I am writing this content, I can invoke a special syntax that then allows me to make use a library of web components that are available in the context of the site it is rendered on.\nIn this case the secret incantation is simply the normal declaritive usage of the web component desired. So for code-bed it looks something like <code-bed data-slug-hash\"wVGGzV\"></code-bed>.\nSo while that is the version I see, the version you see is:\n\nThere is one slight danger to this methodology as it requires the content be interpreted as HTML. An alternative methodology would utilize a transformation layer to convert from some pre-defined activation command into the corresponding HTML representation during render.\nAnyway I'm just gonna have a little more fun and add one more, mainly cause I can now haha.\nCheers!\n\n",

The API's aren't too much different, of course they have changed some, but the coolest part. Is how viable they have actually become.\nThey are a lot more widely supported by browsers now. Of course they are not supported by all, and if you still want to support older browsers, well you are a little fucked, but they simply won't render and you can provide a fallback scenario by providing HTML within your custom element tag.\nAnyway, I went ahead and made a few, and they are incorporated in this site now. One in the footer, and one at the top of each content article, like this one.\nOne of them is a simple web component to display social network contact info via social network branded buttons/logos.\nIt simply displays them in a block fashion, side by side, only renderng the social networks you provide info for.\nThe second one displays the readability of a piece of text content and also the average time it would take to read this same content. This one was interesting as it also had me learn about how to exactly calcule or estimate the readability of a piece of text content.\nThrough creating both of these components, I also learned about a new way to distrubute scripts or share these web components and that is through an ES6 module script tag. You can now point script tags at modules, which is freaking awesome. And this is also relatively widely supported.\nThese components are literally the only script tags included on this site right now. This site has practically no scripting as it is all server rendered. If your browser doesn't support web components they simply won't render, so your experience will be the same as before.\nOn that note, this site will likely never be fancy, I care less and less about that and more and more about keeping it simple and accessible. Anyway, the components I created are on my GitHub and are completely open source, feel free to tweak them or use them on your own site or wherever. And if you don't like something or there is a bug, open up an issue and I might fix it or yell back haha, I play.\n",

I am still learning and forever will continue to do so.\nI'm trying to get back into the home brewing game though, it has been a few months since I last brewed a beer.\nCurrently setting out to brew an IPA. The recipe being used comes from John Palmer's How To Brew book. The IPA is called Victory and Chaos.
